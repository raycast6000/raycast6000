### Hi there!
I'm the laziest dev you'll ever meet. Anyways, I like low-level software development and web stuff. My favorite languages are Rust, C/C++, and Lua. And also, I am a proud Python hater.
Sometimes I might be a bit inactive because of some teenager stuff but I always try to deliver high quality products.

### Who are you?
A 15-year-old kid in his mom's basement tryna become the next Jeff Bezos by making a bunch of useless projects that no one will ever care about.
### What are your interests?
- Reverse engineering
- Game hacking
- Low-level programming
- Slacking off \
\
Overall, nerdy stuff lol
