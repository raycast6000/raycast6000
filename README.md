### heya!
I'm the laziest dev you'll ever meet. Anyways, I like low-level development as well as front-end stuff. My favorite languages are Rust, C/C++ and Lua.
### Who tf are you?
A 15 yo Argentinian kiddo in his mom's basement tryna become the next Jeff Bezos by making a bunch of useless projects that no one will ever care about.
### What are your interests?
- Reverse engineering
- Game hacking
- Low-level programming \
Overall, nerdy stuff. But sometimes I find myself making a website just for the sake of it. Btw, Angular on top.
