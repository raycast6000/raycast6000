### Hi there!
I'm the laziest dev you'll ever meet. Anyways, I like low-level development and front-end stuff. My favorite languages are Rust, C/C++, and Lua. And I am a proud Python hater.
There are periods when I am not very active and periods when I make 5012431 commits a day. I'm a bit unpredictable.
### Who are you?
A 15-year-old kid in his mom's basement tryna become the next Jeff Bezos by making a bunch of useless projects that no one will ever care about.
### What are your interests?
- Reverse engineering
- Game hacking
- Low-level programming \
\
Overall, nerdy stuff. But sometimes I find myself making a website just for the sake of it. Btw, Angular is the 🐐.
